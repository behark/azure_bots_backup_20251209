## 🎯 MASTER RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

#### Liquidation Bot:
- ❌ Remove: RIVER, ADA, ICP
- ✅ Keep: POWER (best performer)
- ⚠️ Review BULLISH signal logic (underperforms)

#### Funding Bot:
- ❌ Remove: RIVER (catastrophic), JELLYJELLY
- ✅ Keep: POWER (exceptional), BLUAI, IRYS
- ✅ Focus more on BEARISH signals

#### Volume Bot:
- ❌ Remove: BLUAI, POWER, MON
- ✅ Keep: RIVER (excellent here!), MINA, BOB
- ⚠️ Investigate why TP2 rarely hits (2.4%)
- ⚠️ Reduce signal frequency (204 signals in one day is too many)

### Cross-Bot Strategy

#### Use Bot-Specific Watchlists:
```
Liquidation: POWER, CLO, BLUAI, APR
Funding: POWER, BLUAI, IRYS (focus BEARISH)
Volume: RIVER, MINA, BOB, KITE
```

**DO NOT use universal watchlist!** Each bot has different edge for different symbols.

## 📈 KEY LEARNINGS

### What Makes Signals Win:

1. **POWER in Funding/Liquidation** - extraordinary edge
2. **BEARISH signals** in Funding Bot - huge P&L
3. **RIVER in Volume Bot** - 93% win rate
4. **High R:R ratios** - Liquidation Bot's 1:2.46 allows sub-50% win rate to profit

### What Makes Signals Lose:

1. **RIVER in Funding/Liquidation** - massive losses
2. **BULLISH bias** in Funding Bot - consistently loses
3. **Over-trading** - Volume Bot's 204 signals/day dilutes quality
